# Olist_Ecommerce_Project
End-to-end data analytics &amp; forecasting project using the Olist E-commerce dataset. Includes data cleaning, EDA, Power BI dashboard, and a Random Forest model to predict monthly sales for urban logistics optimization.


Urban Logistics Performance & Prediction using E-Commerce Data
An end-to-end data analytics and forecasting project analyzing urban logistics performance using the Olist E-commerce dataset.
This project explores customer behavior, product performance, payment trends, and delivery efficiency — and uses machine learning to forecast future sales.

Key Features
Data Preparation & Cleaning:
Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and validated relationships across multiple CSVs.
Created readable naming conventions and mapped IDs for easy reference.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Identified trends in order growth, payment preferences, product categories, and delivery delays.
Detected high-value customers and premium product segments.
Interactive Power BI Dashboard:
Visualizes KPIs such as total revenue, top categories, seller rankings, customer locations, and payment method usage.
Enables filtering and drill-down for deeper insights.

Sales Forecasting (Machine Learning):
Built a Random Forest Regressor model using lag features (Lag_1, Lag_12) to capture seasonality.
Forecasts monthly sales for better inventory, delivery, and marketing planning.
Growth Strategies & Recommendations:
Delivery optimization through regional courier partnerships and predictive ETAs.
Loyalty programs for high-value customers.
Payment flexibility with EMI and mobile-first checkout.
Inventory and marketing plans aligned with predicted seasonal demand.

Tech Stack
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Excel, Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Visualization: Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning: scikit-learn (Random Forest Regressor)


Dataset: Olist E-commerce (Brazil)
